            "description": "Working from the earliest surviving draft of Frankenstein, Charles E. Robinson presents two versions of the classic novel\u2014as Mary Shelley originally wrote it and a subsequent version clearly indicating Percy Shelley\u2019s amendments and contributions. For the first time we can hear Mary\u2019s sole voice, which is colloquial, fast-paced, and sounds more modern to a contemporary reader. We can also see for the first time the extent of Percy Shelley\u2019s contribution\u2014some 5,000 words out of 72,000\u2014and his stylistic and thematic changes. His occasionally florid prose is in marked contrast to the directness of Mary\u2019s writing. Interesting, too, are Percy\u2019s suggestions, which humanize the monster, thus shaping many of the major themes of the novel as we read it today. In these two versions of Frankenstein we have an exciting new view of one of literature\u2019 s greatest works.",

Shelley started writing the story when she was only 18. Frankenstein is infused with elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. At the same time, it is an early example of science fiction. It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories, films and plays.",

            "description": "D.L. Macdonald and Kathleen Scherf\u2019s edition of Frankenstein has been widely acclaimed as an outstanding edition of the novel\u2014for the general reader and the student as much as for the scholar. The editors use as their copy-text the original 1818 version, and detail in an appendix all of Shelley\u2019s later revisions. They also include a range of contemporary documents that shed light on the historical context from which this unique masterpiece emerged. New to this edition is a discussion of Percy Shelley\u2019s role in contributing to the first draft of the novel. Recent scholarship has provoked considerable interest in the degree to which Percy Shelley contributed to Mary Shelley\u2019s original text, and this edition\u2019s updated introduction discusses this scholarship. A new appendix also includes Lord Byron\u2019s \u201cA Fragment\u201d and John William Polidori\u2019s The Vampyre, works that are engaging in their own right and that also add further insights into the literary context of Frankenstein.",

            "description": "The best-selling student edition on the market, now available in a Second Edition. Almost two centuries after its publication, Frankenstein remains an indisputably classic text and Mary Shelley's finest work. This extensively revised Norton Critical Edition includes new texts and illustrative materials that convey the enduring global conversation about Frankenstein and its author. The text is that of the 1818 first edition, published in three volumes by Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, and Jones. It is accompanied by an expansive new preface, explanatory annotations, a map of Geneva and its environs, and seven illustrations, five of them new to the Second Edition. Context is provided in three supporting sections: \"Circumstance, Influence, Composition, Revision,\" \"Reception, Impact, Adaptation,\" and \"Sources, Influences, Analogues.\" Among the Second Edition's new inclusions are historical-cultural studies by Susan Tyler Hitchcock, William St. Clair, and Elizabeth Young; Chris Baldrick on the novel's reception; and David Pirie on the novel's many film adaptations. Related excerpts from the Bible and from John Milton's Paradise Lost are now included, as is Charles Lamb's poem \"The Old Familiar Faces.\" \"Criticism\" collects sixteen major interpretations of Frankenstein, nine of them new to the Second Edition. The new contributors are Peter Brooks, Bette London, Garrett Stewart, James. A. W. Heffernan, Patrick Brantlinger, Jonathan Bate, Anne Mellor, Jane Goodall, and Christa Knellwolf. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.",

He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened... Frankenstein is the most celebrated horror story ever written. It tells the dreadful tale of Victor Frankenstein, a visionary young student of natural philosophy, who discovers the secret of life. In the grip of his obsession he constructs a being from dead body parts, and animates this creature. The results, for Victor and for his family, are catastrophic. Written when Mary Shelley was just eighteen, Frankenstein was inspired by the ghost stories and vogue for Gothic literature that fascinated the Romantic writers of her time. She transformed these supernatural elements an epic parable that warned against the threats to humanity posed by accelerating technological progress. Published for the 200th anniversary, this edition, based on the original 1818 text, explains in detail the turbulent intellectual context in which Shelley was writing, and also investigates how her novel has since become a byword for controversial practices in science and medicine, from manipulating ecosystems to vivisection and genetic modification. As an iconic study of power, creativity, and, ultimately, what it is to be human, Frankenstein continues to shape our thinking in profound ways to this day.",

Eclectic learning, pungent black humour, sometimes degenerating into facetiousness, a stately but singular style distinguish all his writing. His impressionistic reminiscences both of his own childhood and of his literary contemporaries are memorably vivid. His greatest achievement was his psychological study of the faculty of dreaming in \"Suspiria de Profundis\" and \"The English Mail Coach\", in which he traced -twenty five years before Freud was born- how childhood experiences and sufferings are crystallized in dreams into symbols which can form and educate the dreamer\u00b4s personality.",

'On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth' offers both a small masterpiece of Shakespearian interpretation and a provocative statement of De Quincey's personal aesthetic of contrast and counterpoint. Suspiria de Profundis blends autobiography and philosophical speculation into a series of dazzling prose-poems which explore the mysteries of time, memory, and suffering. 'The English Mail-Coach' develops a richly apocalyptic vision which sets nineteenth-century England's political and imperial grandeur against the suffering and loss of innocence which it entails. This selection presents De Quincey's major works in their original uncut and unrevised versions, which in some cases have not been available for many years.",

In 1821, he went to London to dispose of some translations from German authors, but was persuaded first to write and publish an account of his opium experiences, which that year appeared in the London Magazine. This new sensation eclipsed Lamb's Essays of Elia, which were then appearing in the same periodical. He then made literary acquaintances. He maintained himself by contributing to various magazines. His other works include On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth (1823), Walladmor (1825), Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts (1827), The Logic of the Political Economy (1844), Biographical Essays (1851), Autobiographical Sketches (1853), Romances and Extravaganzas (1877), and Collected Writings (1889).",

Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are.",

One of the most enduringly popular writers of modern literature, Wells here assured his position as one of the fathers of imaginative literature with his psychologically complex tale of a scientist who renders himself invisible and eventually goes mad because of it. And because it focuses more on people than on technology, it remains a compelling tale even more than a century after it was written. British author HERBERT GEORGE WELLS (1866-1946) is best known for his groundbreaking science fiction novels *The Time Machine* (1895), *The Invisible Man* (1897), and *The War of the Worlds* (1898).",

Wells's The Invisible Man is a riveting exploration of science's power to corrupt With his face swaddled in bandages, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses and his hands covered even indoors, Griffin - the new guest at The Coach and Horses - Is at first assumed to be a shy accident-victim. But the true reason for his disguise is far more chilling: he has developed a process that has made him invisible, and is locked in a struggle to discover the antidote. Forced from the village and driven to murder, he seeks the aid of his old friend Kemp. The horror of his fate has affected his mind, however - and when Kemp refuses to help, Griffin resolves to wreak his revenge. This edition includes a full biographical essay on Wells, a further reading list and detailed notes on the text. In his introduction, Christopher Priest considers the novel's impact upon modern literature.

            "description": "The Invisible Man is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. Originally serialized in Pearson's Weekly in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man to whom the title refers is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and who invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light. He carries out this procedure on himself and renders himself invisible, but fails in his attempt to reverse it. A practitioner of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction. While its predecessors, The Time Machine and The Island of Doctor Moreau, were written using first-person narrators, Wells adopts a third-person objective point of view in The Invisible Man. The novel is considered influential, and helped establish Wells as the \"father of science fiction\"",

A young scientist who discovers the secret of invisibility feels initial joy at his newfound freedoms and abilities, but quickly turns to despair when he realizes the many things he has sacrificed in the pursuit of science. While he struggles to create the formula that will restore his visibility and his connection to other people, murder and mayhem ensue. THE ART OF THE NOVELLA Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers but beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. The Art of the Novella Series celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners. The series has been recognized for its \"excellence in design\" by AIGA.",

There, stranded on a slowly dying Earth, he discovers two bizarre races: the effete Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks\u2014a haunting portrayal of Darwin\u2019s evolutionary theory carried to a terrible conclusion. The Invisible Man is the fascinating tale of a brash young scientist who, experimenting on himself, becomes invisible and then criminally insane, trapped in the terror of his own creation. Convincing and unforgettably real, these two classics are consummate representations of the stories that defined science fiction\u2014and inspired generations of readers and writers.

The Invisible Man of the title is \"Griffin\", a scientist who theorizes that if a person's refractive index is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will not be visible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but cannot become visible again, becoming mentally unstable as a result.Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 - 13 August 1946)-known as H. G. Wells-was a prolific English writer in many genres, including the novel, history, politics, social commentary, and textbooks and rules for war games. Wells is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is called a \"father of science fiction\", along with Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback. His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), and The War of the Worlds (1898). He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.",

Here, in an authoritative single-volume edition restoring Alcott\u2019s original text as well as her sister May (the original of Amy)\u2019s illustrations, is the complete series. Set in a small New England town during the Civil War and Reconstruction, Little Women introduces Alcott\u2019s remarkable heroines, the March sisters\u2014above all, her alter ego Jo March, with her literary ambition and independent spirit. The follow-up, Little Men, follows Jo into adulthood and marriage as she finds herself the caretaker of a houseful of rambunctious children at Plumfield School. Jo\u2019s Boys returns to Plumfield a decade later; now grown, Jo\u2019s children recount adventures of their own. At once heartwarming and true to life, Alcott\u2019s novels will continue to win over readers both young and old, as they have for generations. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation\u2019s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America\u2019s best and most significant writing.

The four girls each exhibit individual flaws and much of the plot is concerned with their journey to correct themselves, always supporting each other in the end despite their numerous squabbles. Margaret \"Meg\" March is the eldest sister and at the beginning of the tale is very preoccupied with materialistic possessions, Josephine \"Jo\" March is a tomboy with a fiery temper, Elizabeth \"Beth\" March is shy and gentle and Amy, being the youngest March sister, is spoilt and therefore prone to temper tantrums. Little Women follows the sisters for about a year, but Good Wives skips forward in time regularly so that by the end they are all of adult age. Little Men, or Life at Plumfield with Jo's Boys is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott, first published in 1871. Little Men follows the adventures of Jo March and her husband Professor Bhaer as they try to make their school for boys a happy, comfortable, and stimulating place. Jo's Boys was first published in 1886. The novel is the final book in the unofficial Little Women series. In it, Jo's \"children,\" now grown, are caught up in real world troubles. Louisa May Alcott (1832 \u2013 1888) was an American novelist best known as author of the novel Little Women and its sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys.",

The book takes place ten years after Little Men. Dolly and George are college students dealing with the temptations of snobbery, arrogance, self-indulgence and vanity. Tommy becomes a medical student to impress childhood sweetheart Nan, but after \"accidentally\" falling in love with and proposing to Dora, he joins his family business.",

As Harker wends his way through the picturesque countryside, the local peasants warn him about his destination, giving him crucifixes and other charms against evil and uttering strange words that Harker later translates into \u201cvampire.\u201dFrightened but no less determined, Harker meets the count's carriage as planned. The journey to the castle is harrowing, and the carriage is nearly attacked by angry wolves along the way. Upon arriving at the crumbling old castle, Harker finds that the elderly Dracula is a well educated and hospitable gentleman. After only a few days, however, Harker realizes that he is effectively a prisoner in the castle.",

            "description": "Count Dracula has inspired countless movies, books, and plays. But few, if any, have been fully faithful to Bram Stoker's original, best-selling novel of mystery and horror, love and death, sin and redemption. Dracula chronicles the vampire's journey from Transylvania to the nighttime streets of London. There, he searches for the blood of strong men and beautiful women while his enemies plot to rid the world of his frightful power. Today's critics see Dracula as a virtual textbook on Victorian repression of the erotic and fear of female sexuality. In it, Stoker created a new word for terror, a new myth to feed our nightmares, and a character who will outlive us all. This book includes three novels: Dracula, The Jewel of Seven Stars and The Lair of the White Worm. It also includes a short fiction collection called Dracula's Guest and Other Stories: Dracula's Guest; The Judge's House; The Squaw; The Secret of Growing Gold; The Gipsy Prophecy; The Coming of Abel Behenna; The Burial of the Rats; A Dream of Red Hands; Crooken Sands; The Crystal Cup; The Chain of Destiny and The Dualitists.",

            "description": "Since its publication in 1897, Dracula has enthralled generation after generation of readers with the same spellbinding power with which Count Dracula enthralls his victims. Though Bram Stoker did not invent vampires, and in fact based his character\u2019s life-in-death on extensive research in European folklore, his novel elevated the nocturnal creature to iconic stature, spawning a genre of stories and movies that flourishes to this day. But a century of imitations has done nothing to diminish the power of Stoker\u2019s tale. As his chilling, suave monster stalks his prey from a crumbling castle in the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania to an insane asylum in England to the bedrooms of his swooning female victims, the drama is infused with a more and more exquisite measure of sensuality and suspense. Dracula is a classic of Gothic horror, an undying wellspring of modern mythology, and an irresistible entertainment.",

Enter freely and of your own will.\u201dJonathan Harker has little idea that his business trip to meet the mysterious Count of Transylvania would turn into his worst nightmare. Held captive in Dracula\u2019s strange, dark castle, Jonathan discovers that the Count is in fact a vampire, who has been living on human blood for centuries! Soon, Dracula claims his first victim, the beautiful Lucy Westenra, a friend of Jonathan\u2019s wife Mina. But this is just the beginning of Dracula\u2019s cruel intentions. And evil must be vanquished, before it can claim more victims! Now, it will take some clever and courageous people\u2014Professor Van Helsing, Dr Seward, Arthur Holmwood, Quincey Morris, Jonathan and Mina Harker\u2014to outwit and completely destroy the indomitable Dracula. Much before vampires became a fad for the 21st-century reader, Bram Stoker wrote Dracula. Packed with action, thrill and horror, and written in an epistolary form, this mother-of-all gothic novels is a classic page-turner.",

            "description": "Essays on the craft of fiction writing from the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize, for her novel The Age of Innocence. In The Writing of Fiction,Edith Wharton, a prolific writer and one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest authors, shares her thoughts on fiction writing, devoting individual chapters to short stories and novels. She stresses the importance of writers putting thought into how they build their story, from selecting subject matter and fashioning characters to crafting situations and settings. She explores the history of modern fiction and the contributions of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and Stendhal. She even examines the difference between literary and commercial fiction, as well as the work of Marcel Proust. Although Wharton passed away in 1937, her advice here endures and is bound to inspire writers for ages to come. \u201cIn The Writing of Fiction Edith Wharton gives us not only a period-appropriate glimpse into the mind of an exceptionally creative writer but also an appreciation for the thoughtfulness and discipline she brought to her craft. We are fortunate she was willing to share her observations.\u201d \u2014Ralph White, author of Litchfield",

The Red House was the biggest house of the Highfield summer colony, and Cobham Stilling was its biggest man.

            "description": "Glennard had never thought himself a hero; but he had been certain that he was incapable of baseness. The story of a young man who scorns the love of a tortured novelist, only to have her words come back to haunt him from the dead, The Touchstone shows off the skills Wharton became famous for in novels such as Ethan Frome and House of Mirth, particularly her piercing and delicious talent for satiric observation. But despite its masterly control, this startlingly modern tale is also a simmering, rebel cri de coeur unleashed by a writer who was herself unappreciated in her own time. The combination of these attributes make this edgy novella a moving and suspenseful homage to the power of literature itself. The Art of The Novella Series Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.",

            "description": "A New York Review Books Original Edith Wharton wrote about New York as only a native can. Her Manhattan is a city of well-appointed drawing rooms, hansoms and broughams, all-night cotillions, and resplendent Fifth Avenue flats. Bishops\u2019 nieces mingle with bachelor industrialists; respectable wives turn into excellent mistresses. All are governed by a code of behavior as rigid as it is precarious. What fascinates Wharton are the points of weakness in the structure of Old New York: the artists and writers at its fringes, the free-love advocates testing its limits, widows and divorc\u00e9es struggling to hold their own. The New York Stories of Edith Wharton gathers twenty stories of the city, written over the course of Wharton\u2019s career. From her first published story, \u201cMrs. Manstey\u2019s View,\u201d to one of her last and most celebrated, \u201cRoman Fever,\u201d this new collection charts the growth of an American master and enriches our understanding of the central themes of her work, among them the meaning of marriage, the struggle for artistic integrity, the bonds between parent and child, and the plight of the aged. Illuminated by Roxana Robinson\u2019s Introduction, these stories showcase Wharton\u2019s astonishing insight into the turbulent inner lives of the men and women caught up in a rapidly changing society.",

            "description": "Edith Wharton ( born Edith Newbold Jones; January 24, 1862 - August 11, 1937) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American novelist, short story writer, and designer. She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927, 1928 and 1930.Wharton combined her insider's view of America's privileged classes with a brilliant, natural wit to write humorous, incisive novels and short stories of social and psychological insight. She was well acquainted with many of her era's other literary and public figures, including Theodore Roosevelt.Edith Wharton was born Edith Newbold Jones to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander at their brownstone at 14 West Twenty-third Street in New York City. She had two much older brothers, Frederic Rhinelander, who was sixteen, and Henry Edward, who was eleven. She was baptized April 20, 1862, Easter Sunday, at Grace Church. To her friends and family she was known as \"Pussy Jones\".The saying \"keeping up with the Joneses\" is said to refer to her father's family. She was also related to the Rensselaer family, the most prestigious of the old patroon families. She had a lifelong lovely friendship with her Rhinelander niece, landscape architect Beatrix Farrand of Reef Point in Bar Harbor, Maine. Edith was born during the Civil War; she was three years old when the South surrendered. After the war, the family traveled extensively in Europe.From 1866 to 1872, the Jones family visited France, Italy, Germany, and Spain.During her travels, the young Edith became fluent in French, German, and Italian. At the age of ten, she suffered from typhoid fever while the family was at a spa in the Black Forest. After the family returned to the United States in 1872, they spent their winters in New York and their summers in Newport, Rhode Island. While in Europe, she was educated by tutors and governesses. She rejected the standards of fashion and etiquette that were expected of young girls at the time, intended to enable women to marry well and to be displayed at balls and parties. She thought these requirements were superficial and oppressive. Edith wanted more education than she received, so she read from her father's library and from the libraries of her father's friends.Her mother forbade her to read novels until she was married, and Edith complied with this command Edith began writing poetry and fiction as a young girl. She attempted to write a novel at age eleven. Her first publication was a translation of the German poem, \"Was die Steine Erz\u00e4hlen\" (\"What the Stones Tell\") by Heinrich Karl Brugsch, which earned her $50. She was 15 at the time. Her family did not wish her name to appear in print because the names of upper class women of the time only appeared in print to announce birth, marriage, and death. Consequently, the poem was published under the name of a friend's father, E. A. Washburn. He was a cousin of Ralph Waldo Emerson and supported women's education. He played a pivotal role in Edith's efforts to educate herself, and he encouraged her ambition to write professionally.In 1877, at the age of 15, she secretly wrote a 30,000 word novella \"Fast and Loose\". In 1878 her father arranged for a collection of two dozen original poems and five translations, Verses, to be privately published. In 1880 she had five poems published anonymously in the Atlantic Monthly, then a revered literary magazine. Despite these early successes, she was not encouraged by her family nor her social circle, and though she continued to write, she did not publish anything again until her poem, \"The Last Giustiniani\", was published in Scribner's Magazine in October 1889.",

            "description": "The Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning biographer of Louisa May Alcott illuminates the world of Little Women and its author. Since its publication in 1868\u201369, Little Women, perhaps America\u2019s most beloved children\u2019s classic, has been handed down from mother to daughter for generations. It has been translated into more than fifty languages and inspired six films, four television shows, a Broadway musical, an opera, and a web series. This lavish, four-color edition features over 220 curated illustrations, including stills from the films, stunning art by Norman Rockwell, and iconic illustrations by children\u2019s-book illustrators Alice Barber Stevens, Frank T. Merrill, and Jessie Wilcox Smith. Renowned Alcott scholar John Matteson brings his expertise to the book, to the March family it creates, and to the Alcott family who inspired it all. Through numerous photographs taken in the Alcott family home expressly for this edition\u2014elder daughter Anna\u2019s wedding dress, the Alcott sisters\u2019 theater costumes, sister May\u2019s art, and Abba Alcott\u2019s recipe book\u2014readers discover the extraordinary links between the real and the fictional family. Matteson\u2019s annotations evoke the once-used objects and culture of a distant but still-relevant time, from the horse-drawn carriages to the art Alcott carefully placed in her story to references to persons little known today. His brilliant introductory essays examine Little Women\u2019s pivotal place in children\u2019s literature and tell the story of Alcott herself\u2014a tale every bit as captivating as her fiction.",

            "description": "Little Women is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888), which was originally published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869. The novel follows the lives of four sisters-Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March-detailing their passage from childhood to womanhood, and is loosely based on the author and her three sisters.[ Four sisters live with their mother, facing Christmas without their father as the American Civil War is underway. The family is settled in a new neighborhood, living in genteel poverty after the father lost their money. Meg and Jo March, the elder sisters, both work outside the home for money to support the family. Meg teaches four children in a nearby family, while Jo aids her grand-aunt March, a wealthy widow whose strength is failing. Beth helps with housework, and Amy attends school. Louisa May Alcott also wrote two sequels to Little Women, both of which also featured the March sisters: Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1886).",
