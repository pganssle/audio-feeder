            "description": "Das Original in \u00fcberarbeiteter deutscher Fassung mit zahlreichen Anmerkungen. Der Londoner Rechtsanwalt Jonathan Harker reist nach Transsilvanien. Er soll dort den Grafen Dracula beraten, der nach England auswandern will und zu diesem Zweck ein Grundst\u00fcck in London erwirbt. W\u00e4hrend seiner Reise trifft Harker auf sehr misstrauische und abergl\u00e4ubische Gestalten, die ihn vor dem Grafen warnen. Im Schloss des Grafen verlaufen die Tage zun\u00e4chst ruhig, da sich der Gastgeber selbst bei Tage nicht blicken l\u00e4sst. Aber dann sch\u00f6pft Harker Verdacht, denn der Graf hat kein Spiegelbild. Bald schon ahnt der junge Engl\u00e4nder von der unheimlichen Macht seines Gegners. Und er weiss, dass er die Mauern des Schlosses nie lebend verlassen wird, wenn er nicht flieht. In London wartet ein Heer von ahnungslosen Opfern auf den Vampir. Bram Stoker hat in diesem Roman Tod und Erotik auf faszinierende Art zusammengef\u00fchrt. Dieses Buch geh\u00f6rt zur anerkannten Weltliteratur, es l\u00e4sst sich auf verschiedenste Art interpretieren und lesen, als viktorianisches Sittengem\u00e4lde, als spannender Abenteuerroman und als Schauerroman. 2. Auflage Umfang: 600 Normseiten bzw. 615 Buchseiten.",

There, he searches for the blood of strong men and beautiful women while his enemies plot to rid the world of his frightful power. Today's critics see Dracula as a virtual textbook on Victorian repression of the erotic and fear of female sexuality. In it, Stoker created a new word for terror, a new myth to feed our nightmares, and a character who will outlive us all. This book includes three novels: Dracula, The Jewel of Seven Stars and The Lair of the White Worm. It also includes a short fiction collection called Dracula's Guest and Other Stories: Dracula's Guest; The Judge's House; The Squaw; The Secret of Growing Gold; The Gipsy Prophecy; The Coming of Abel Behenna; The Burial of the Rats; A Dream of Red Hands; Crooken Sands; The Crystal Cup; The Chain of Destiny and The Dualitists.",

            "description": "Since its publication in 1897, Dracula has enthralled generation after generation of readers with the same spellbinding power with which Count Dracula enthralls his victims. Though Bram Stoker did not invent vampires, and in fact based his character\u2019s life-in-death on extensive research in European folklore, his novel elevated the nocturnal creature to iconic stature, spawning a genre of stories and movies that flourishes to this day. But a century of imitations has done nothing to diminish the power of Stoker\u2019s tale. As his chilling, suave monster stalks his prey from a crumbling castle in the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania to an insane asylum in England to the bedrooms of his swooning female victims, the drama is infused with a more and more exquisite measure of sensuality and suspense. Dracula is a classic of Gothic horror, an undying wellspring of modern mythology, and an irresistible entertainment.",

Here, in an authoritative single-volume edition restoring Alcott\u2019s original text as well as her sister May (the original of Amy)\u2019s illustrations, is the complete series. Set in a small New England town during the Civil War and Reconstruction, Little Women introduces Alcott\u2019s remarkable heroines, the March sisters\u2014above all, her alter ego Jo March, with her literary ambition and independent spirit. The follow-up, Little Men, follows Jo into adulthood and marriage as she finds herself the caretaker of a houseful of rambunctious children at Plumfield School. Jo\u2019s Boys returns to Plumfield a decade later; now grown, Jo\u2019s children recount adventures of their own. At once heartwarming and true to life, Alcott\u2019s novels will continue to win over readers both young and old, as they have for generations. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation\u2019s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America\u2019s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",

Little Women is recognized as one of the best-loved classic children's stories, transcending the boundaries of time and age, making it as popular with adults as it is with young readers. The beloved story of the March girls is a classic American feminist novel, reflecting the tension between cultural obligation and artistic and personal freedom. But which of the four March sisters to love best? For every reader must have their favorite. Independent, tomboyish Jo; delicate, loving Beth; pretty, kind Meg; or precocious and artistic Amy, the baby of the family? The charming story of these four \"little women\" and their wise and patient mother Marmee enduring hardships and enjoying adventures in Civil War New England was an instant success when first published in 1868 and has been adored for generations.",

            "description": "The Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning biographer of Louisa May Alcott illuminates the world of Little Women and its author. Since its publication in 1868\u201369, Little Women, perhaps America\u2019s most beloved children\u2019s classic, has been handed down from mother to daughter for generations. It has been translated into more than fifty languages and inspired six films, four television shows, a Broadway musical, an opera, and a web series. This lavish, four-color edition features over 220 curated illustrations, including stills from the films, stunning art by Norman Rockwell, and iconic illustrations by children\u2019s-book illustrators Alice Barber Stevens, Frank T. Merrill, and Jessie Wilcox Smith. Renowned Alcott scholar John Matteson brings his expertise to the book, to the March family it creates, and to the Alcott family who inspired it all. Through numerous photographs taken in the Alcott family home expressly for this edition\u2014elder daughter Anna\u2019s wedding dress, the Alcott sisters\u2019 theater costumes, sister May\u2019s art, and Abba Alcott\u2019s recipe book\u2014readers discover the extraordinary links between the real and the fictional family. Matteson\u2019s annotations evoke the once-used objects and culture of a distant but still-relevant time, from the horse-drawn carriages to the art Alcott carefully placed in her story to references to persons little known today. His brilliant introductory essays examine Little Women\u2019s pivotal place in children\u2019s literature and tell the story of Alcott herself\u2014a tale every bit as captivating as her fiction.",

The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, \"We haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She didn't say \"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience.

The novel follows the lives of four sisters-Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March-detailing their passage from childhood to womanhood, and is loosely based on the author and her three sisters.[ Four sisters live with their mother, facing Christmas without their father as the American Civil War is underway. The family is settled in a new neighborhood, living in genteel poverty after the father lost their money. Meg and Jo March, the elder sisters, both work outside the home for money to support the family. Meg teaches four children in a nearby family, while Jo aids her grand-aunt March, a wealthy widow whose strength is failing. Beth helps with housework, and Amy attends school. Louisa May Alcott also wrote two sequels to Little Women, both of which also featured the March sisters: Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1886).",

Nominated as one of America\u2019s best-loved novels by PBS\u2019s The Great American Read 2018 marks the bicentennial of Mary Shelley\u2019s seminal novel. For the first time, Penguin Classics will publish the original 1818 text, which preserves the hard-hitting and politically-charged aspects of Shelley\u2019s original writing, as well as her unflinching wit and strong female voice. This edition also emphasizes Shelley\u2019s relationship with her mother\u2014trailblazing feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who penned A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\u2014and demonstrates her commitment to carrying forward her mother\u2019s ideals, placing her in the context of a feminist legacy rather than the sole female in the company of male poets, including Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. This edition includes a new introduction and suggestions for further reading by National Book Critics Circle award-winner and Shelley expert Charlotte Gordon, literary excerpts and reviews selected by Gordon, and a chronology and essay by preeminent Shelley scholar Charles E. Robinson. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,800 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",

            "description": "Working from the earliest surviving draft of Frankenstein, Charles E. Robinson presents two versions of the classic novel\u2014as Mary Shelley originally wrote it and a subsequent version clearly indicating Percy Shelley\u2019s amendments and contributions. For the first time we can hear Mary\u2019s sole voice, which is colloquial, fast-paced, and sounds more modern to a contemporary reader. We can also see for the first time the extent of Percy Shelley\u2019s contribution\u2014some 5,000 words out of 72,000\u2014and his stylistic and thematic changes. His occasionally florid prose is in marked contrast to the directness of Mary\u2019s writing. Interesting, too, are Percy\u2019s suggestions, which humanize the monster, thus shaping many of the major themes of the novel as we read it today. In these two versions of Frankenstein we have an exciting new view of one of literature\u2019 s greatest works.",

At the same time, it is an early example of science fiction. It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories, films and plays.",

Macdonald and Kathleen Scherf\u2019s edition of Frankenstein has been widely acclaimed as an outstanding edition of the novel\u2014for the general reader and the student as much as for the scholar. The editors use as their copy-text the original 1818 version, and detail in an appendix all of Shelley\u2019s later revisions. They also include a range of contemporary documents that shed light on the historical context from which this unique masterpiece emerged. New to this edition is a discussion of Percy Shelley\u2019s role in contributing to the first draft of the novel. Recent scholarship has provoked considerable interest in the degree to which Percy Shelley contributed to Mary Shelley\u2019s original text, and this edition\u2019s updated introduction discusses this scholarship. A new appendix also includes Lord Byron\u2019s \u201cA Fragment\u201d and John William Polidori\u2019s The Vampyre, works that are engaging in their own right and that also add further insights into the literary context of Frankenstein.",

            "description": "The best-selling student edition on the market, now available in a Second Edition. Almost two centuries after its publication, Frankenstein remains an indisputably classic text and Mary Shelley's finest work. This extensively revised Norton Critical Edition includes new texts and illustrative materials that convey the enduring global conversation about Frankenstein and its author. The text is that of the 1818 first edition, published in three volumes by Lackington, Hughes, Harding, Mavor, and Jones. It is accompanied by an expansive new preface, explanatory annotations, a map of Geneva and its environs, and seven illustrations, five of them new to the Second Edition. Context is provided in three supporting sections: \"Circumstance, Influence, Composition, Revision,\" \"Reception, Impact, Adaptation,\" and \"Sources, Influences, Analogues.\" Among the Second Edition's new inclusions are historical-cultural studies by Susan Tyler Hitchcock, William St. Clair, and Elizabeth Young; Chris Baldrick on the novel's reception; and David Pirie on the novel's many film adaptations. Related excerpts from the Bible and from John Milton's Paradise Lost are now included, as is Charles Lamb's poem \"The Old Familiar Faces.\" \"Criticism\" collects sixteen major interpretations of Frankenstein, nine of them new to the Second Edition. The new contributors are Peter Brooks, Bette London, Garrett Stewart, James. A. W. Heffernan, Patrick Brantlinger, Jonathan Bate, Anne Mellor, Jane Goodall, and Christa Knellwolf. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.",

He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened... Frankenstein is the most celebrated horror story ever written. It tells the dreadful tale of Victor Frankenstein, a visionary young student of natural philosophy, who discovers the secret of life. In the grip of his obsession he constructs a being from dead body parts, and animates this creature. The results, for Victor and for his family, are catastrophic. Written when Mary Shelley was just eighteen, Frankenstein was inspired by the ghost stories and vogue for Gothic literature that fascinated the Romantic writers of her time. She transformed these supernatural elements an epic parable that warned against the threats to humanity posed by accelerating technological progress. Published for the 200th anniversary, this edition, based on the original 1818 text, explains in detail the turbulent intellectual context in which Shelley was writing, and also investigates how her novel has since become a byword for controversial practices in science and medicine, from manipulating ecosystems to vivisection and genetic modification. As an iconic study of power, creativity, and, ultimately, what it is to be human, Frankenstein continues to shape our thinking in profound ways to this day.",

Here, in an authoritative single-volume edition restoring Alcott\u2019s original text as well as her sister May (the original of Amy)\u2019s illustrations, is the complete series. Set in a small New England town during the Civil War and Reconstruction, Little Women introduces Alcott\u2019s remarkable heroines, the March sisters\u2014above all, her alter ego Jo March, with her literary ambition and independent spirit. The follow-up, Little Men, follows Jo into adulthood and marriage as she finds herself the caretaker of a houseful of rambunctious children at Plumfield School. Jo\u2019s Boys returns to Plumfield a decade later; now grown, Jo\u2019s children recount adventures of their own. At once heartwarming and true to life, Alcott\u2019s novels will continue to win over readers both young and old, as they have for generations. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation\u2019s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America\u2019s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",

            "description": "Little Women and Good Wives, published in 1868 and 1869 respectively, is a story following the four March sisters and their friend Theodore \"Laurie\" Lawrence in Massachusetts in the 1800's. The four girls each exhibit individual flaws and much of the plot is concerned with their journey to correct themselves, always supporting each other in the end despite their numerous squabbles. Margaret \"Meg\" March is the eldest sister and at the beginning of the tale is very preoccupied with materialistic possessions, Josephine \"Jo\" March is a tomboy with a fiery temper, Elizabeth \"Beth\" March is shy and gentle and Amy, being the youngest March sister, is spoilt and therefore prone to temper tantrums. Little Women follows the sisters for about a year, but Good Wives skips forward in time regularly so that by the end they are all of adult age. Little Men, or Life at Plumfield with Jo's Boys is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott, first published in 1871. Little Men follows the adventures of Jo March and her husband Professor Bhaer as they try to make their school for boys a happy, comfortable, and stimulating place. Jo's Boys was first published in 1886. The novel is the final book in the unofficial Little Women series. In it, Jo's \"children,\" now grown, are caught up in real world troubles. Louisa May Alcott (1832 \u2013 1888) was an American novelist best known as author of the novel Little Women and its sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys.",

In The Writing of Fiction,Edith Wharton, a prolific writer and one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest authors, shares her thoughts on fiction writing, devoting individual chapters to short stories and novels. She stresses the importance of writers putting thought into how they build their story, from selecting subject matter and fashioning characters to crafting situations and settings. She explores the history of modern fiction and the contributions of Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and Stendhal. She even examines the difference between literary and commercial fiction, as well as the work of Marcel Proust. Although Wharton passed away in 1937, her advice here endures and is bound to inspire writers for ages to come. \u201cIn The Writing of Fiction Edith Wharton gives us not only a period-appropriate glimpse into the mind of an exceptionally creative writer but also an appreciation for the thoughtfulness and discipline she brought to her craft. We are fortunate she was willing to share her observations.\u201d \u2014Ralph White, author of Litchfield",

            "description": "A rare work of nonfiction from Edith Wharton, The Writing of Fiction contains brilliant advice on writing from the first woman ever to win a Pulitzer Prize -- for her first novel The Age of Innocence. In The Writing of Fiction, Wharton provides general comments on the roots of modern fiction, the various approaches to writing a piece of fiction, and the development of form and style. She also devotes entire chapters to the telling of a short story, the construction of a novel, and the importance of character and situation in the novel. Not only a valuable treatise on the art of writing, The Writing of Fiction also allows readers to experience the inimitable but seldom heard voice of one of America's most important and beloved writers, and includes a final chapter on the pros and cons of Marcel Proust.",

            "description": "A New York Review Books Original Edith Wharton wrote about New York as only a native can. Her Manhattan is a city of well-appointed drawing rooms, hansoms and broughams, all-night cotillions, and resplendent Fifth Avenue flats. Bishops\u2019 nieces mingle with bachelor industrialists; respectable wives turn into excellent mistresses. All are governed by a code of behavior as rigid as it is precarious. What fascinates Wharton are the points of weakness in the structure of Old New York: the artists and writers at its fringes, the free-love advocates testing its limits, widows and divorc\u00e9es struggling to hold their own. The New York Stories of Edith Wharton gathers twenty stories of the city, written over the course of Wharton\u2019s career. From her first published story, \u201cMrs. Manstey\u2019s View,\u201d to one of her last and most celebrated, \u201cRoman Fever,\u201d this new collection charts the growth of an American master and enriches our understanding of the central themes of her work, among them the meaning of marriage, the struggle for artistic integrity, the bonds between parent and child, and the plight of the aged. Illuminated by Roxana Robinson\u2019s Introduction, these stories showcase Wharton\u2019s astonishing insight into the turbulent inner lives of the men and women caught up in a rapidly changing society.",

            "description": "In the years since its publication in 1988, Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time has established itself as a landmark volume in scientific writing. It has become an international publishing phenomenon, translated into forty languages and selling over nine million copies. The book was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the nature of the universe, but since that time there have been extraordinary advances in the technology of macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawkin's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these many observations, as well as his recent research, for this expanded edition Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on the fascinating subject of wormholes and time travel, and updated the original chapters. In addition, to heighten understanding of complex concepts that readers may have found difficult to grasp despite the clarity and wit of Professor Hawking's writing, this edition is enhanced throughout with more than 240 full-color illustrations, including satellite images, photographs made made possible by spectacular technological advance such as the Hubble Space Telescope, and computer generated images of three and four-dimensional realities. Detailed captions clarify these illustrations, enable readers to experience the vastness of intergalactic space, the nature of black holes, and the microcosmic world of particle physics in which matters and antimatter collide. A classic work that now brings to the reader the latest understanding of cosmology, A Brief History Of Time is the story of the ongoing search for t he tantalizing secrets at the heart of time and space.",

But for years readers have asked for a more accessible formulation of its key concepts\u2014the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, and the history and future of the universe. A Briefer History of Time is Professor Hawking\u2019s response. Although \u201cbriefer,\u201d this book is much more than a mere explanation of Hawking\u2019s earlier work. A Briefer History of Time both clarifies and expands on the great subjects of the original, and records the latest developments in the field\u2014from string theory to the search for a unified theory of all the forces of physics. Thirty-seven full-color illustrations enhance the text and make A Briefer History of Time an exhilarating and must-have addition in its own right to the great literature of science and ideas.",

            "description": "Stephen Hawking\u2019s phenomenal, multimillion-copy bestseller, A Brief History of Time, introduced the ideas of this brilliant theoretical physicist to readers all over the world. Now, in a major publishing event, Hawking returns with a lavishly illustrated sequel that unravels the mysteries of the major breakthroughs that have occurred in the years since the release of his acclaimed first book. The Universe in a Nutshell \u2022 Quantum mechanics \u2022 M-theory \u2022 General relativity \u2022 11-dimensional supergravity \u2022 10-dimensional membranes \u2022 Superstrings \u2022 P-branes \u2022 Black holes One of the most influential thinkers of our time, Stephen Hawking is an intellectual icon, known not only for the adventurousness of his ideas but for the clarity and wit with which he expresses them. In this new book Hawking takes us to the cutting edge of theoretical physics, where truth is often stranger than fiction, to explain in laymen\u2019s terms the principles that control our universe. Like many in the community of theoretical physicists, Professor Hawking is seeking to uncover the grail of science \u2014 the elusive Theory of Everything that lies at the heart of the cosmos. In his accessible and often playful style, he guides us on his search to uncover the secrets of the universe \u2014 from supergravity to supersymmetry, from quantum theory to M-theory, from holography to duality. He takes us to the wild frontiers of science, where superstring theory and p-branes may hold the final clue to the puzzle. And he lets us behind the scenes of one of his most exciting intellectual adventures as he seeks \u201cto combine Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman\u2019s idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe.\u201d With characteristic exuberance, Professor Hawking invites us to be fellow travelers on this extraordinary voyage through space-time. Copious four-color illustrations help clarify this journey into a surreal wonderland where particles, sheets, and strings move in eleven dimensions; where black holes evaporate and disappear, taking their secret with them; and where the original cosmic seed from which our own universe sprang was a tiny nut. The Universe in a Nutshell is essential reading for all of us who want to understand the universe in which we live. Like its companion volume, A Brief History of Time, it conveys the excitement felt within the scientific community as the secrets of the cosmos reveal themselves.",

But for years readers have asked for a more accessible formulation of its key concepts\u2014the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, and the history and future of the universe. A Briefer History of Time is Professor Hawking\u2019s response. Although \u201cbriefer,\u201d this book is much more than a mere explanation of Hawking\u2019s earlier work. A Briefer History of Time both clarifies and expands on the great subjects of the original, and records the latest developments in the field\u2014from string theory to the search for a unified theory of all the forces of physics. Thirty-seven full-color illustrations enhance the text and make A Briefer History of Time an exhilarating and must-have addition in its own right to the great literature of science and ideas.",
