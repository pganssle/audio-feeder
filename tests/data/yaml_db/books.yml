  description: '<p>It''s one of the most famous novels of the 19th century, and probably
    the one that''s least actually read. *The Invisible Man,* first published in 1897,
    became the basis for the classic 1933 film starring Claude Rains-as well as its
    many spinoffs-but the novel is quite different: it''s an early example of science
    fantasy that was as much about character as it was about concept. One of the most
    enduringly popular writers of modern literature, Wells here assured his position
    as one of the fathers of imaginative literature with his psychologically complex
    tale of a scientist who renders himself invisible and eventually goes mad because
    of it. And because it focuses more on people than on technology, it remains a
    compelling tale even more than a century after it was written. British author
    HERBERT GEORGE WELLS (1866-1946) is best known for his groundbreaking science
    fiction novels *The Time Machine* (1895), *The Invisible Man* (1897), and *The
    War of the Worlds* (1898).</p>'
